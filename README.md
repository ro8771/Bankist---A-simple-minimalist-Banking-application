# Bankist---A-simple-minimalist-Banking-application

- This is a simple, minimalist, single-page Banking web application that I coded along with Jonas Schmedtmann for sections 11-12 of his Javascript course on Udemy.
- For more context surrounding this project, please check out 15th December of the Progress repo's ReadMe where I chart my learning progress and activities.
- This simple application has several features, including logging in, transfering money to other accounts, requesting loan, closing an account, displaying of money movements, displaying of current balance and other summaries,
a log-out timer, etc.
